                    <h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction:</h1>
                    <p class="introduction">
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a paradigm in computer science and technology that seeks to imbue machines with the ability to perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence. The goal is to create systems capable of learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and adapting to diverse situations. AI encompasses a spectrum of techniques and approaches, ranging from rule-based systems to advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The concept of AI has deep historical roots, with early philosophical and mythological inquiries into the nature of intelligence. However, the modern pursuit of AI as a scientific discipline began in the mid-20th century. In 1955, John McCarthy, along with Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, organized the Dartmouth Conference, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. This marked the formal beginning of AI as an academic and research field.

                    <h1 style="text-align: left;">AI Invention:</h1>
                    <p class="introduction">
                        Certainly, the development of artificial intelligence involves the contributions of several key individuals. Here are brief mentions of the contributions of three important figures:
                        <br>
                        <strong>Alan Turing:</strong> 
                        <br>
                        Contribution: Alan Turing made foundational contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. His concept of the Turing machine laid the theoretical groundwork for computation and the idea of algorithmic processes. Turing's work during World War II, including his efforts to break the Enigma code, showcased the practical application of his ideas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>John McCarthy:</strong>
                        <br>
                        Contribution: John McCarthy is often referred to as the father of artificial intelligence. In 1955, he organized the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a field. McCarthy developed the LISP programming language, which became influential in AI research. His work laid the early framework for the development of AI as an academic discipline.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Marvin Minsky</strong>
                        <br>
                        Contribution: Marvin Minsky was a cognitive scientist and computer scientist known for his work in AI and robotics. He co-founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project and, along with McCarthy, wrote the seminal paper "A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence." Minsky's research focused on perception, learning, and the symbolic representation of knowledge in machines.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These individuals, along with others, played crucial roles in shaping the early foundations of artificial intelligence as both a theoretical concept and a practical field of study.
